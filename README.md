Its a simple Mean stack Task application used for adding tasks, viewing it and also deleting it 

Before running this app, make sure to install Node and Mongo DB(https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/ for ubuntu). I have taken this example app from 
http://www.bogotobogo.com/MEAN-Stack/MEAN-Stack-MongoDB-ExpressJS-AngularJS-NodeJS-ToDoList-App.php
